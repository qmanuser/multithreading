Multithreading is a technique where multiple threads are spawned
by a process to do different tasks, at about the same time,
just one after the other. This gives you the illusion that the threads are running
in parallel, but they are actually run in a concurrent manner.
In Python, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) prevents the threads from running simultaneously.
Multiprocessing is a technique where parallelism in
its truest form is achieved. Multiple processes are run across multiple CPU cores,
which do not share the resources among them.
Each process can have many threads running in its own memory space.
In Python, each process has its own instance of
Python interpreter doing the job of executing the instructions.
